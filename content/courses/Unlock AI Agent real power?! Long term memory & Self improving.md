sections:
- description: Discussion on the limitations of dataless AI agents and the benefits
    of incorporating memory for improved user experience and task efficiency.

  title: "\U0001F914 The Need for Long-Term Memory in AI Agents"
- description: Analogy of human learning process (attention, encoding, consolidation,
    long-term memory) to illustrate the concept of long-term memory in AI agents.  Discusses
    the difference between how human memories can fade and how AI agents can maintain
    perfect memory.

  title: "\U0001F9E0 How Humans Learn: A Guiding Principle"
- description: Explanation of a knowledge agent architecture which processes user-agent
    interactions to identify and store valuable information in a vector database for
    later retrieval.  Illustrative example of storing user preferences (e.g., dietary
    restrictions).
  timestamp: 03:11
  title: "\U0001F916 Architecting a Knowledge Agent"
- description: Strategies for optimizing knowledge retrieval to balance speed, accuracy
    and cost. This includes using cheaper models for initial checks, prioritization
    of information, and archiving older, less-frequently used data.

  title: "\U0001F680 Optimizing Knowledge Retrieval"
- description: 'Examples of projects implementing long-term memory in AI agents: MIM
    GPT (Memory GPT),  continuously learning language agent (CLNA), and enhanced customer
    support agents.  These examples highlight different approaches and applications.'

  title: "\U0001F4A1 Real-world Examples and Implementations"
- description: Step-by-step tutorial on adding long-term memory to an AutoGen agent
    in under 10 minutes. This covers setting up configurations, installing necessary
    packages, and using the `teachable` agent ability.
  timestamp: '13:14'
  title: "\U0001F6E0Ô∏è Implementing Long-Term Memory in AutoGen (Practical Example)"
- description: Detailed explanation of the `teachable` agent's components, including
    the `MemoStore` class for database interaction, the `TextAnalyzer` agent, and
    the `storage` and `retrieval` functions.
